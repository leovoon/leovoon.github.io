import ScrollAnimation from "../../components/vue/ScrollAnimation.vue";

Inspired by the captivating scrolling animation on the [remix.run](https://remix.run/) website, I decided to give it a shot in Vue. In this blog post, I'll share my trial and walk you through the process step-by-step. Join me as we recreate this mesmerizing effect using Vue.js and the powerful `useIntersectionObserver` hook from vueuse. Let's get started!

Here's the view of the effect:

```vue
<div ref="sidebarRef" class="h-80vh grid content-center">
  Trigger sidebar highlight
</div>
. . .
<div
  class="h-full p-2 border transition-colors ease-in-out"
  :class="sidebarVisible && 'bg-blue-300 outline-dotted-blue-500'"
>
  Sidebar
</div>
```

To achieve the sticky scrolling animation, I relied on the useIntersectionObserver hook from vueuse. It allowed me to detect when elements come into view as I scrolled through the page.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useIntersectionObserver } from "@vueuse/core";

const sidebarRef = ref(null);
const sidebarVisible = ref(false);

useIntersectionObserver(
  sidebarRef,
  ([{ isIntersecting }]) => {
    sidebarVisible.value = isIntersecting;
  },
  { threshold: 0.6 }
);
</script>
```

## Demo

<ScrollAnimation client:load />

I had a blast experimenting with this animation, and I hope it sparks your curiosity too. If you'd like to see the full code, check out the GitHub repository. Hope you enjoyed this post.
