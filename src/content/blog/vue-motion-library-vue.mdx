import RedPacket from "../../components/vue/RedPacket.vue";

To celebrate the Lunar New Year, I wanted to create a fun and interactive Red Packet demo using Vue. Luckily, I came across the amazing @vueuse/motion library, which made the animation part a breeze. Let's dive into the steps to create this exciting demo.

You can find the complete source code for the Red Packet demo at [red-packet-demo.vue](https://github.com/leovoon/explore-vue/blob/main/src/components/RedPacketDemo.vue). Feel free to explore and customize it to your liking.

First, let's install the @vueuse/motion package by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @vueuse/motion
```

To use @vueuse/motion as a global plugin in your Vue app, you need to import and configure it. Here's how you can do it:

```js
import { MotionPlugin } from "@vueuse/motion";

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(MotionPlugin);

app.mount("#app");
```

By adding the MotionPlugin as a global plugin, you can easily access and use the animation features provided by @vueuse/motion throughout your app.
