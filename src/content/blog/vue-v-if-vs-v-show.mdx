## v-if

- event listeners and child components inside the conditional block are destroyed and re-created during toggles.
- can group on `<template>`. The rendered result will not include the `<template>` element.

```html
<template v-if="isShow">
  <div>
    <p>Hello</p>
  </div>
  <button>Say Hi</button>
</template>
```

- can use together `v-else-if` and `v-else`

## v-show

- always rendered and remains in the DOM regardless of initial condition
- only toggles the display CSS property of the element.
- does not support `template` and `v-else`

```html
<template>
  <h1 v-show="isShow">Hello world</h1>
</template>
```

### In short

Use `v-show` if you need to toggle something very often.
Use `v-if` if you need to toggle something more conditionally.

Happy Vue-ing!
